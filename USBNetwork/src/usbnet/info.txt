Hello! If you're wondering what all this weird stuff on your Kindle is,
I'm a usbnetwork hack! There's a good chance that I came from here:
http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=186645

I'm at version 0.21.N, so, if you wish to uninstall me, you'll need the
uninstaller from that version, or from a newer one.

NOTE: Rename the 'DISABLED_auto' file to 'auto' if you want your Kindle to act
as Ethernet Over USB instead of Mass Storage USB by default.
Make sure your config is sane before doing this, though.
